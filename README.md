# guess_the_word
Python program for picking random words from a text file and guessing them letter by letter!

You'll see a random word from the .txt file in the "data" folder with all letters covered except the first and the last one. You win the game if you manage to guess the word
before making 20 mistakes. Change line 20 in main.py to reduce the max number of mistakes and make the game more interesting. Change the filename on line 18 to use your own text file!
